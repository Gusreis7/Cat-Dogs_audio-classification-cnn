Hey, this is a very basic implementation of a CNN for audio classification purpuses.
The propose of this repository is to study how CNNs and improve my skills, on this field
The implemention was made in Pytorch, using  OOP for better writen code and usage for my experiments.

For this work, I used a public dataset of audio classification, who contains 2 classes, dogs and cats, the dataset is avaible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/audio-cats-and-dogs
